## 1. 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the session "Build Applications with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode in VS Code"! In this session, we will explore how GitHub Copilot Agent Mode can revolutionize your development workflow by acting as an autonomous peer programmer. This feature enables multi-step coding tasks, including analyzing your codebase, proposing edits, running terminal commands, and iterating to resolve issues.

### Key Highlights

- **What is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode?**

  - A next-generation AI tool that assists developers in automating repetitive tasks and enhancing productivity.

- **Why Attend?**

  - Learn how to leverage GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to streamline your coding process.
  - Gain hands-on experience with real-world examples and demos.

- **Session Goals:**
  - Understand the capabilities of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.
  - Explore its features, including autonomous operation, multi-step task execution, and self-healing capabilities.
  - Learn how to integrate it into your development workflow effectively.

## 2. 📋 Session Details

Copilot agent mode is the next evolution in AI-assisted coding. Acting as an autonomous peer programmer, it performs multi-step coding tasks at your command — analyzing your codebase, reading relevant files, proposing file edits, and running terminal commands and tests. It responds to compile and lint errors, monitors terminal and test output, and auto-corrects in a loop until the task is completed.

## 3. 📝 Session Abstract

GitHub has significantly enhanced its Copilot offering with the preview release of agent mode. This feature aims to streamline and automate code editing workflows, allowing developers to iterate on code changes more efficiently using natural language prompts. Agent mode takes GitHub Copilot even further by enabling Copilot to autonomously plan and execute tasks, including suggesting and running terminal commands, and iterating to resolve issues. These advancements signify a move towards a more "agentic AI" that proactively assists developers throughout the development lifecycle.

## 4. 🤖 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. GitHub Copilot Inline Suggestions

GitHub Copilot provides inline suggestions as you type, offering code snippets, function completions, and even entire blocks of code. These suggestions are context-aware, meaning they adapt to the code you are writing and the comments you provide. This feature helps developers save time by reducing the need to search for syntax or boilerplate code.

### 2. GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat allows developers to interact with Copilot in a conversational manner. You can ask questions, request explanations for code, or even ask for debugging assistance. This feature integrates seamlessly into your IDE, providing a more interactive and intuitive coding experience.

### 3. GitHub Copilot Edits

Copilot Edits enable developers to make changes to their codebase efficiently. By providing natural language instructions, you can ask Copilot to refactor code, fix bugs, or implement new features. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining clean and optimized code.

### 4. GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

Agent Mode is an advanced feature that allows Copilot to act autonomously. It can perform multi-step coding tasks, such as analyzing your codebase, proposing edits, running terminal commands, and iterating to resolve issues. This mode transforms Copilot into a proactive assistant that can handle complex workflows.

### 5. Chat Participants, Variables, and Slash Commands

This feature enhances the interactivity of GitHub Copilot Chat by introducing participants, variables, and slash commands. Participants allow you to define roles (e.g., user, assistant) in a conversation. Variables enable dynamic content generation, while slash commands provide quick access to predefined actions or templates, making the chat experience more powerful and efficient.

## 5. 🎯 Key Takeaways

By the end of this session, participants will:

- Gain a deep understanding of GitHub Copilot agent mode features, including:
  - **Autonomous operation**: Copilot can independently analyze, plan, and execute tasks without constant user intervention.
  - **Multi-step tasks**: Handles complex workflows involving multiple steps, such as editing, testing, and debugging.
  - **Tools for task completion**: Utilizes built-in tools to complete tasks efficiently, like running terminal commands or editing files.
  - **Iteration and self-healing**: Automatically iterates to fix errors and resolve issues during task execution.
  - **User control and review**: Allows users to review and approve changes, ensuring control over the development process.
  - **Context management**: Maintains awareness of the project context to provide relevant suggestions and actions.
  - **Undo and redo**: Supports undoing or redoing actions to correct mistakes or revisit previous states.
  - **Interrupting requests**: Enables users to pause or stop ongoing tasks for better flexibility and control.
