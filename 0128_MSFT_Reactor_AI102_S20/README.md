## 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

`Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)` is an advanced AI framework that enhances the capabilities of language models by combining `retrieval-based methods` with `generative models`. In essence, RAG integrates external knowledge sources into the generative process, making the model's responses more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to specific contexts.

### 3.1. Key Components of RAG

#### **Retrieval**

> - RAG systems query an external knowledge base, such as a document store, database, or search engine, to fetch the most relevant information.
> - Tools like Azure Cognitive Search, vector databases, or embeddings-based search mechanisms are often used to identify and retrieve relevant documents or pieces of information.

#### **Augmentation**

> - The retrieved information is used as context for the language model.
> - This augmentation ensures that the model's response is grounded in factual, retrieved data rather than relying solely on its pretrained knowledge.

#### **Generation**

- A generative language model (e.g., Azure OpenAI's GPT models) processes the retrieved context alongside the input query to produce a coherent and informed response.

### 3.2. Benefits of RAG

> 1. **Accuracy**: Ensures responses are based on the most relevant and up-to-date information.
> 1. **Contextual Awareness**: Incorporates domain-specific or private knowledge sources that the model wouldn't have seen during its training.
> 1. **Scalability**: Works well for large-scale deployments where models need to adapt to varied or niche information domains.
> 1. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces reliance on larger models by leveraging external knowledge effectively.

### 3.3. Example Workflow in Azure OpenAI

> 1. **User Query**: A user asks, _"What are the latest features of Azure OpenAI?"_.
> 1. **Information Retrieval**: The system queries an indexed knowledge base containing Azure OpenAI documentation, release notes, and other materials.
> 1. **Augmented Prompt**: The retrieved documents are appended to the query as part of the prompt.
> 1. **Response Generation**: Azure OpenAI GPT generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context.

### 3.4. Use Cases

> 1. **Customer Support**: Providing real-time, accurate answers using product manuals or troubleshooting guides.
> 1. **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Leveraging private, secure repositories to assist employees with organizational knowledge.
> 1. **Research Assistance**: Summarizing and generating insights based on scientific papers or datasets.

## 4. Provision Azure Resources

> 1. Azure OpenAI Resource: For running GPT models.
> 1. Azure AI Search Resource: For indexing and retrieving data.
> 1. Azure Storage Account: For storing your dataset (e.g., brochures).

## 5. Upload Your Data

> 1. Store your data (e.g., PDF brochures) in an Azure Blob Storage container.
> 1. Example: Create a container margies-travel and upload the brochures.

## 6. Deploy AI Models

> 1. Embedding Model (text-embedding-ada-002): Converts text into vectors for indexing.
> 1. Generative Model (gpt-35-turbo-16k): Generates responses using your indexed data.

## 7. Create an Index

> 1. Use Azure AI Search to index the brochures:
>    - Set up a connection to your Blob Storage container.
>    - Use the embedding model to vectorize the text.
>    - Enable semantic ranking for better search relevance.
> 1. Result: A searchable index (margies-index) is created.
