- Build API-based tools using Azure Functions
- Create a working knowledge worker agent

## 🛠️ The Azure AI Agent Toolkit

### 1. Azure OpenAI Service: The Brain of Your Agent

**What it provides:**

- **GPT-4 & GPT-4o**: Advanced language models for reasoning and text generation
- **Embeddings**: Convert text into vector representations for semantic search
- **Function Calling**: Enable structured interactions with external tools
- **Content Safety**: Built-in safety filters and responsible AI features

**Key Capabilities for Agents:**

```text
🧠 Natural Language Understanding
🎯 Function/Tool Calling
🔄 Multi-turn Conversations
📊 Structured Data Extraction
✅ Content Moderation
```

### 2. Azure AI Studio: The Orchestration Platform

**What it provides:**

- **Prompt Flow**: Visual workflow designer for AI applications
- **Model Management**: Deploy and version control AI models
- **Evaluation Tools**: Test and validate agent performance
- **Integration Hub**: Connect to various data sources and services

**Why it matters for agents:**

- Simplifies complex AI workflows
- Provides visual debugging and monitoring
- Enables rapid prototyping and iteration
- Offers enterprise-grade deployment options

### 3. Azure AI Search: Memory and Knowledge Retrieval

**What it provides:**

- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search using embeddings
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector and keyword search
- **Semantic Ranking**: AI-powered result ranking
- **Knowledge Mining**: Extract insights from unstructured data

**RAG Implementation Benefits:**

- Grounds AI responses in your specific data
- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides source attribution
- Enables real-time knowledge updates

### 4. Azure Functions & Logic Apps: The Hands and Feet

**Azure Functions:**

- Serverless compute for custom tools
- Event-driven execution
- Multiple language support
- Automatic scaling

**Logic Apps:**

- Visual workflow designer
- 400+ pre-built connectors
- Enterprise integration patterns
- No-code/low-code approach
