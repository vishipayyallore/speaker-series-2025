## 6. Techniques in Prompt Engineering

### Core Techniques

- **Single Turn**: Crafting prompts for one-off tasks.
- **Iterative**: Refining prompts through multiple iterations.
- **Conversational**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.
- **Role Play**: Assigning roles to guide model behavior.
- **Zero Shot**: Providing no examples in the prompt.
- **Single Shot**: Providing one example in the prompt.
- **Few Shots**: Providing multiple examples in the prompt.
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Breaking down problems into logical steps.

---

## 7. Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

### Key Guidelines

- **Be Explicit**: Clearly define the task and expected output.
- **Test and Iterate**: Continuously refine prompts based on results.
- **Leverage Context**: Provide relevant background information.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly evaluate and tweak prompts.

```

```text
# Example 9: Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompt
Please solve the following problem using a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, which involves breaking the problem down into smaller, logical steps to ensure a clear and systematic progression to the solution. Show each intermediate step and explain your reasoning.

Example Problem: "A bakery had 50 cupcakes. They sold 15 in the morning and then baked 20 more in the afternoon. How many cupcakes do they have now?"

**Expected CoT Response:**

1. Start with the initial number of cupcakes: 50.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes sold in the morning: \( 50 - 15 = 35 \).
3. Add the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon: \( 35 + 20 = 55 \).
4. The bakery now has 55 cupcakes.

Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?
